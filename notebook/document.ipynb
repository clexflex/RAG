Ltd. began not as a big company, but with a big\\nmindset - and here we are, growing, surviving, and building something truly meaningful in one of the\\nmost competitive industries out there.\\nToday, as we celebrate that journey, I want to take a few minutes to share how this company\\nshaped mine - and introduce something new we\\'ve quietly been building.\\nFor someone like me, who joined as an intern not even a year and a half ago, it\\'s honestly hard to\\nexplain in words what this place has given me - but today, I\\'ll try.\\nFrom \"Doing Tasks\" to \"Owning the Vision\"\\nWhen I first entered the company, I came with one simple goal: learn as much as possible.\\nI was the only full stack developer at the time - no senior devs to fall back on, no tech team. Just me\\nand the belief that I\\'ll figure it out.\\nGanesh sir used to double-check every task I completed - which, looking back now, I\\'m actually\\nthankful for. It pushed me to be more careful, more thorough, and most importantly - more\\nresponsible.\\nOver time, the trust grew. The scope grew. But more than that, my thinking changed - from \"what\\ntask do I have today\" to \"what value can I create?\"\\nAnd that mindset led me to something very close to my heart - MMR Statistics.\\nMMR Statistics - Not Just a Website, But a Statement\\nIn early February this year, Vikas sir mentioned something in a conversation - a simple idea, that we\\nhave thousands of tables, market data, and estimations from our research reports... but we\\'re only\\nsending them as Excel sheets.\\nHe asked, \"What if we build something like a SaaS platform - something like Statista?\"'),\n",

I estimated we\\'d\\nneed a team of 12-15 people.\\nBut when we reached out to outsource it, the budget and timeline didn\\'t match the vision. That\\'s\\nwhen Vikas sir asked me directly - \"Can you build it in-house?\"\\nAnd I won\\'t lie - I was scared. But I said Yes.\\nBecause saying Yes meant believing in something bigger than my own comfort zone.\\nExecution Over Ideas\\nWith support from the company, I started building a team from scratch.To build something of this\\nscale, you need more than code - you need a small, passionate team.\\nI interviewed over 30 students. I hired Parth, Ritanshu, Sakshi - and together, we designed\\nprototypes, user flows, and began development.\\nEvery day involved new challenges - architecture, optimization, handling subscriptions, designing\\nvisibility rules, securing payments.\\nBy August, things started to take shape.\\nWhen the first interns\\' tenure ended, it was bittersweet - but their work remained foundational.\\nLater, Siddhi and Kiran joined, and today they\\'re part of the engine pushing this forward.\\nWe\\'ve implemented 4 subscription tiers, dynamic URL access depending on subscription, custom\\nreport section options, and data visibility systems that restrict or allow based on subscription - all\\nbuilt in-house using Next.js, MongoDB, and our own pipelines.\\nWhat MMR Statistics Means for Us\\nThis platform is not just a project.

See figures on India's economic growth here , and the Russian GDP for comparison.   Historical development of the Indian economy In the 1950s and 1960s, the decision of the newly independent Indian government to adopt a mixed economy, adopting both elements of both capitalist and socialist systems, resulted in huge inefficiencies borne out of the culture of interventionism that was a direct result of the lackluster implementation of policy and failings within the system itself. The desire to move towards a Soviet style mass planning system failed to gain much momentum in the Indian case due to a number of hindrances, an unskilled workforce being one of many.   When the government of the early 90’s saw the creation of small-scale industry in large numbers due to the removal of price controls, the economy started to bounce back, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union - India’s main trading partner - the hampering effects of socialist policy on the economy were exposed and it underwent a large-scale liberalization. By the turn of the 21st century, India was rapidly progressing towards a free-market economy.

      "The statistic shows GDP in India from 1987 to 2024, with projections up until 2030. In 2024, GDP in India was at around 3.91 trillion U.S. dollars, and it is expected to reach six trillion by the end of the decade. See figures on India's economic growth here , and the Russian GDP for comparison.   Historical development of the Indian economy In the 1950s and 1960s, the decision of the newly independent Indian government to adopt a mixed economy, adopting both elements of both capitalist and socialist systems, resulted in huge inefficiencies borne out of the culture of interventionism that was a direct result of the lackluster implementation of policy and failings within the system itself. The desire to move towards a Soviet style mass planning system failed to gain much momentum in the Indian case due to a number of hindrances, an unskilled workforce being one of many.   When the government of the early 90’s saw the creation of small-scale industry in large numbers due to the removal of price controls, the economy started to bounce back, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union - India’s main trading partner - the hampering effects of socialist policy on the economy were exposed and it underwent a large-scale liberalization. By the turn of the 21st century, India was rapidly progressing towards a free-market economy. India’s development has continued and it now belongs to the BRICS group of fast developing economic powers, and the incumbent Modi administration has seen India's GDP double during its first decade in power.\n",
