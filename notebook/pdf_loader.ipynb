While\\nthey were powerful and ushered in a host of applications like aca-\\ndemic research and e-commerce, they were limited to providing\\na list of relevant websites for user queries. However, the recent\\nsuccess of large language models [ 5, 21] has paved the way for\\nbetter systems like BingChat, Google’s SGE, and perplexity.ai that\\ncombine conventional search engines with generative models. We\\ndub these systems generative engines (GE) because they search for\\ninformation and generate multi-modal responses by using multiple\\nsources. Technically, generative engines (Figure 2) retrieve relevant\\ndocuments from a database (like the internet) and use large neural\\nmodels to generate a response grounded on the sources, ensuring\\nattribution and a way for the user to verify the information.\\nThe usefulness of generative engines for developers and users\\nis evident – users access information faster and more accurately,\\nwhile developers craft precise and personalized responses, improv-\\ning user satisfaction and revenue. However, generative engines\\ndisadvantage the third stakeholder – website and content creators.\\nGenerative Engines, in contrast to traditional search engines, re-\\nmove the need to navigate to websites by directly providing a\\nprecise and comprehensive response, potentially reducing organic\\ntraffic to websites and impacting their visibility [16]. With millions\\nof small businesses and individuals relying on online traffic and\\nvisibility for their livelihood, generative engines will significantly\\ndisrupt the creator economy. Further, the black-box and propri-\\netary nature of generative engines makes it difficult for content\\narXiv:2311.09735v3  [cs.LG]  28 Jun 2024'),\n",

GEO’s black-box optimization framework then enables the website owner of the pizza website,\\nwhich lacked visibility originally, to optimize their website to increase visibility under Generative Engines. Further, GEO’s\\ngeneral framework allows content creators to define and optimize their custom visibility metrics, giving them greater control\\nin this new emerging paradigm.\\ncreators to control and understand how their content is ingested\\nand portrayed.\\nIn this work, we propose the first general creator-centric frame-\\nwork to optimize content for generative engines, which we dub\\nGenerative Engine Optimization (GEO), to empower content\\ncreators to navigate this new search paradigm. GEO is a flexible\\nblack-box optimization framework for optimizing web content vis-\\nibility for proprietary and closed-source generative engines (Fig-\\nure 1). GEO ingests a source website and outputs an optimized\\nversion by tailoring and calibrating the presentation, text style, and\\ncontent to increase visibility in generative engines.\\nFurther, GEO introduces a flexible framework for defining visi-\\nbility metrics tailor-made for generative engines as the notion of\\nvisibility in generative engines is more nuanced and multi-faceted\\nthan traditional search engines (Figure 3). While average ranking\\non the response page is a good measure of visibility in traditional\\nsearch engines, which present a linear list of websites, this does\\nnot apply to generative engines. Generative Engines provide rich,\\nstructured responses and embed websites as inline citations in the\\nresponse, often embedding them with different lengths, at varying\\npositions, and with diverse styles. This necessitates the need for vis-\\nibility metrics tailor-made for generative engines, which measure\\nthe visibility of attributed sources over multiple dimensions, such\\nas relevance and influence of citation to query, measured through\\nboth an objective and a subjective lens.\\nTo facilitate faithful and extensive evaluation of GEO methods,\\nwe propose GEO-bench, a benchmark consisting of 10000 queries\\nfrom diverse domains and sources, adapted for generative engines.\\nThrough systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed\\nGenerative Engine Optimization methods can boost visibility by\\nup to 40% on diverse queries, providing beneficial strategies for con-\\ntent creators. Among other things, we find that including citations,\\nquotations from relevant sources, and statistics can significantly\\nboost source visibility, with an increase of over 40% across various\\nqueries. We also demonstrate the efficacy of Generative Engine\\nOptimization on Perplexity.ai, a real-world generative engine and\\ndemonstrate visibility improvements up to 37%.\\nIn summary, our contributions are three-fold:\\n(1) We propose Generative Engine Optimization, the first gen-\\neral optimization framework for website owners to optimize their\\nwebsites for generative engines. Generative Engine Optimiza-\\ntion can improve the visibility of websites by up to 40% on a wide\\nrange of queries, domains, and real-world black-box generative\\nengines.\\n(2) Our framework proposes a comprehensive set of visibility met-\\nrics specifically designed for generative engines and enables content\\ncreators to flexibly optimize their content through customized visi-\\nbility metrics.\\n(3) To foster faithful evaluation of GEO methods in generative en-\\ngines, we propose the first large-scale benchmark consisting of\\ndiverse search queries from wide-ranging domains and datasets\\nspecially tailored for Generative Engines.'),\n",

Generative En-\\ngines primrarily consists of a set of generative models and a\\nsearch engine to retrieve relevant documents. Generative En-\\ngines take user query as input and through a series of steps\\ngenerate a final response that is grounded in the retrieved\\nsources with inline attributions.\\n2 FORMULATION & METHODOLOGY\\n2.1 Formulation of Generative Engines\\nDespite the deployment of numerous generative engines to millions\\nof users, there is currently no standard framework. We provide a for-\\nmulation that accommodates various modular components in their\\ndesign. We describe a generative engine, which includes several\\nbackend generative models and a search engine for source retrieval.\\nA Generative Engine (GE) takes a user query 𝑞𝑢 and returns a nat-\\nural language response 𝑟, where 𝑃𝑈 represents personalized user\\ninformation. The GE can be represented as a function:\\n𝑓𝐺𝐸 := (𝑞𝑢, 𝑃𝑈 ) → 𝑟 (1)\\nGenerative Engines comprise two crucial components: a.) A set\\nof generative models𝐺 = {𝐺1, 𝐺2...𝐺𝑛 }, each serving a specific pur-\\npose like query reformulation or summarization, and b.) A search\\nengine 𝑆𝐸 that returns a set of sources 𝑆 = {𝑠1, 𝑠2...𝑠𝑚 } given a\\nquery 𝑞. We present a representative workflow in Figure 2, which,\\nat the time of writing, closely resembles the design of BingChat. This\\nworkflow breaks down the input query into a set of simpler queries\\nthat are easier to consume for the search engine. Given a query, a\\nquery re-formulating generative model, 𝐺1 = 𝐺𝑞𝑟 , generates a set\\nof queries 𝑄1 = {𝑞1, 𝑞2...𝑞𝑛 }, which are then passed to the search\\nengine 𝑆𝐸 to retrieve a set of ranked sources𝑆 = {𝑠1, 𝑠2, ..., 𝑠𝑚 }. The\\nsets of sources 𝑆 are passed to a summarizing model 𝐺2 = 𝐺𝑠𝑢𝑚,\\nwhich generates a summary 𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑗 for each source in 𝑆, resulting in\\nthe summary set (𝑆𝑢𝑚 = {𝑆𝑢𝑚1, 𝑆𝑢𝑚2, ..., 𝑆𝑢𝑚𝑚 }). The summary\\nset is passed to a response-generating model 𝐺3 = 𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝 , which\\ngenerates a cumulative response𝑟 backed by sources𝑆. In this work,\\nwe focus on single-turn Generative Engines, but the formulation\\ncan be extended to multi-turn Conversational Generative Engines\\n(Appendix A).\\nThe response 𝑟 is typically a structured text with embedded\\ncitations. Citations are important given the tendency of LLMs to\\nhallucinate information [ 10]. Specifically, consider a response 𝑟\\ncomposed of sentences {𝑙1, 𝑙2...𝑙𝑜 }. Each sentence may be backed\\nby a set of citations that are part of the retrieved set of documents\\n𝐶𝑖 ⊂ 𝑆. An ideal generative engine should ensure all statements\\nin the response are supported by relevant citations (high citation\\nrecall), and all citations accurately support the statements they’re\\nassociated with (high citation precision) [14]. We refer readers to\\nFigure 3 for a representative generative engine response.\\n2.2 Generative Engine Optimization\\nThe advent of search engines led to search engine optimization\\n(SEO), a process to help website creators optimize their content to\\nimprove search engine rankings. Higher rankings correlate with\\nincreased visibility and website traffic. However, traditional SEO\\nmethods are not directly applicable to Generative Engines. This is\\nbecause, unlike traditional search engines, the generative model\\nin generative engines is not limited to keyword matching, and\\nthe use of language models in ingesting source documents and\\nresponse generation results in a more nuanced understanding of\\ntext documents and user query. With generative engines rapidly\\nemerging as the primary information delivery paradigm and SEO\\nis not directly applicable; new techniques are needed. To this end,\\nwe propose Generative Engine Optimization, a new paradigm\\nwhere content creators aim to increase their visibility (or impres-\\nsion) in generative engine responses. We define the visibility of a\\nwebsite (also referred to as a citation)𝑐𝑖 in a cited response 𝑟 by the\\nfunction 𝐼𝑚𝑝 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑟), which the website creator wants to maximize.\\nFrom the generative engine’s perspective, the goal is to maximize\\nthe visibility of citations most relevant to the user query, i.e., maxi-\\nmize Í\\n𝑖 𝑓 (𝐼𝑚𝑝 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑟), 𝑅𝑒𝑙 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑞, 𝑟)), where 𝑅𝑒𝑙 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑞, 𝑟) measures the\\nrelevance of citation 𝑐𝑖 to the query 𝑞 in the context of response 𝑟\\nand 𝑓 is determined by the exact algorithmic design of generative\\nengine and is a black-box function to end-users. Further, both the\\nfunctions 𝐼𝑚𝑝 and 𝑅𝑒𝑙 are subjective and not well-defined yet for\\ngenerative engines, and we define them next.\\n2.2.1 Impressions for Generative Engines. In SEO, a website’s im-\\npression (or visibility) is determined by its average ranking over\\na range of queries. However, generative engines’ output nature\\nnecessitates different impression metrics. Unlike search engines,\\nGenerative Engines combine information from multiple sources\\nin a single response. Factors such as length, uniqueness, and pre-\\nsentation of the cited website determine the true visibility of a\\ncitation. Thus, as illustrated in Figure 3, while a simple ranking\\non the response page serves as an effective metric for impression\\nand visibility in conventional search engines, such metrics are not\\napplicable to generative engine responses.\\nIn response to this challenge, we propose a suite of impression\\nmetrics designed with three key principles in mind: 1.) The metrics\\nshould hold relevance for creators, 2.) They should be explainable,\\nand 3.) They should be easily comprehensible by a broad spectrum\\nof content creators. The first of these metrics, the “Word Count”\\nmetric, is the normalized word count of sentences related to a\\ncitation. Mathematically, this is defined as:\\n𝐼𝑚𝑝 𝑤𝑐 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑟) =\\nÍ\\n𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑐𝑖\\n|𝑠 |\\nÍ\\n𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑟 |𝑠 | (2)\\nHere 𝑆𝑐𝑖 is the set of sentences citing 𝑐𝑖, 𝑆𝑟 is the set of sentences\\nin the response, and |𝑠 | is the number of words in sentence 𝑠. In\\ncases where a sentence is cited by multiple sources, we share the\\nword count equally with all the citations. Intuitively, a higher word\\ncount correlates with the source playing a more important part in\\nthe answer, and thus, the user gets higher exposure to that source.'),\n",

However, Generative Engines generate rich, structured responses, often embedding citations\\nin a single block interleaved with each other. This makes ranking and visibility nuanced and multi-faceted. Further, unlike\\nsearch engines, where significant research has been conducted on improving visibility, optimizing visibility in generative\\nengine responses remains unclear. To address these challenges, our black-box optimization framework proposes a series of\\nwell-designed impression metrics that creators can use to gauge and optimize their website’s performance and also allows the\\ncreator to define their impression metrics.\\nHowever, since “Word Count” is not impacted by the ranking of\\nthe citations (whether it appears first, for example), we propose a\\nposition-adjusted count that reduces the weight by an exponentially\\ndecaying function of the citation position:\\n𝐼𝑚𝑝 𝑝𝑤𝑐 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑟) =\\nÍ\\n𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑐𝑖\\n|𝑠 | · 𝑒 − 𝑝𝑜𝑠 (𝑠 )\\n|𝑆 |\\nÍ\\n𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑟 |𝑠 | (3)\\nIntuitively, sentences that appear first in the response are more\\nlikely to be read, and the exponent term in definition 𝐼𝑚𝑝 𝑝𝑤𝑐 gives\\nhigher weightage to such citations. Thus, a website cited at the\\ntop may have a higher impression despite having a lower word\\ncount than a website cited in the middle or end of the response.\\nFurther, the choice of exponentially decaying function is motivated\\nby several studies showing click-through rates follow a power-law\\nas a function of ranking in search engines [7, 8]. While the above\\nimpression metrics are objective and well-grounded, they ignore\\nthe subjective aspects of the impact of citations on the user’s at-\\ntention. To address this, we propose the \"Subjective Impression\"\\nmetric, which incorporates facets such as the relevance of the cited\\nmaterial to the user query, influence of the citation, uniqueness of\\nthe material presented by a citation, subjective position, subjective\\ncount, probability of clicking the citation, and diversity in the ma-\\nterial presented. We use G-Eval [15], the current state-of-the-art\\nfor evaluation with LLMs, to measure each of these sub-metrics.\\n2.2.2 Generative Engine Optimization methods for website. To\\nimprove impression metrics, content creators must make changes\\nto their website content. We present several generative engine-\\nagnostic strategies, referred to as Generative Engine Optimiza-\\ntion methods (GEO). Mathematically, every GEO method is a func-\\ntion 𝑓 : 𝑊 → 𝑊 ′\\n𝑖 , where 𝑊 is the initial web content, and 𝑊 ′ is\\nthe modified content after applying the GEO method. The modifi-\\ncations can range from simple stylistic alterations to incorporating\\nnew content in a structured format. A well-designed GEO is equiv-\\nalent to a black-box optimization method that, without knowing\\nthe exact algorithmic design of generative engines, can increase\\nthe website’s visibility and implement textual modifications to𝑊\\nindependent of the exact queries.\\nFor our experiments, we apply Generative Engine Optimiza-\\ntion methods on website content using a large language model,\\nprompted to perform specific stylistic and content changes to the\\nwebsite. In particular, based on the GEO method defining a spe-\\ncific set of desired characteristics, the source content is modified\\naccordingly. We propose and evaluate several such methods:\\n1: Authoritative: Modifies text style of the source content to be\\nmore persuasive and authoritative,2. Statistics Addition: Modifies\\ncontent to include quantitative statistics instead of qualitative dis-\\ncussion, wherever possible, 3. Keyword Stuffing:Modifies content\\nto include more keywords from the query, as expected in classi-\\ncal SEO optimization. 4. Cite Sources & 5. Quotation Addition:\\nAdds relevant citations and quotations from credible sources re-\\nspectively, 6.) 6. Easy-to-Understand: Simplifies the language of\\nwebsite, while 7. Fluency Optimization improves the fluency of\\nwebsite text. 8. Unique Words & 9. Technical Terms: involves\\nadding unique and technical terms respectively wherever possible,\\nThese methods cover diverse general strategies that website\\nowners can implement quickly and use regardless of the website\\ncontent. Further, except for methods 3, 4, and 5, the remaining\\nmethods enhance the presentation of existing content to increase\\nits persuasiveness or appeal to the generative engine, without re-\\nquiring extra content. On the other hand, methods 3,4 and 5 may'),\n",

To analyze the perfor-\\nmance gain of our methods, for each input user query, we randomly\\nselect one source website to be optimized and apply each of the\\nGEO methods separately on the same source. We refer readers to\\nAppendix B.4 for more details on GEO methods.\\n3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\n3.1 Evaluated Generative Engine\\nIn accordance with previous works [14], we use a 2-step setup for\\nGenerative Engine design. The first step involves fetching relevant\\nsources for input query, followed by a second step where an LLM\\ngenerates a response based on the fetched sources. Similar to pre-\\nvous works, we do not use summarization and provide the whole\\nresponse for each source. Due to context length limitations and qua-\\ndratic scaling cost based on the context size of transformer models,\\nonly the top 5 sources are fetched from the Google search engine\\nfor every query. The setup closely mimics the workflow used in\\nprevious works and the general design adopted by commercial GEs\\nsuch as you.com and perplexity.ai. The answer is then generated\\nby the gpt3.5-turbo model [ 20] using the same prompt as prior\\nwork [14]. We sample 5 different responses at temperature=0.7, to\\nreduce statistical deviations.\\nFurther in Section C.1, we evaluate the sameGenerative Engine\\nOptimization methods on Perplexity.ai, which is a commercially\\ndeployed generative engine, highlighting the generalizability of our\\nproposed Generative Engine Optimization methods.\\n3.2 Benchmark : GEO-bench\\nSince there is currently no publicly available dataset containing\\nGenerative Engine related queries, we curateGEO-bench, a bench-\\nmark consisting of 10K queries from multiple sources, repurposed\\nfor generative engines, along with synthetically generated queries.\\nThe benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each\\nfurther categorized based on their target domain, difficulty, query\\nintent, and other dimensions.\\nDatasets: 1. MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Ques-\\ntions: [1, 6, 13] These datasets contain real anonymized user queries\\nfrom Bing and Google Search Engines. These three collectively\\nrepresent the common set of datasets that are used in search en-\\ngine related research. However, Generative Engines will be posed\\nwith far more difficult and specific queries with the intent of syn-\\nthesizing answers from multiple sources instead of searching for\\nthem. To this end, we repurpose several other publicly available\\ndatasets: 4. AllSouls: This dataset contains essay questions from\\n\"All Souls College, Oxford University. \" The queries in this dataset\\nrequire Generative Engines to perform appropriate reasoning to\\naggregate information from multiple sources. 5. LIMA: [25] con-\\ntains challenging questions requiring Generative Engines to not\\nonly aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning\\nto answer the question (e.g., writing a short poem, python code.).\\n6. Davinci-Debtate [14] contains debate questions generated for\\ntesting Generative Engines. 7. Perplexity.ai Discover 2: These\\nqueries are sourced from Perplexity.ai’s Discover section, which is\\n2https://www.perplexity.ai/discover\\nan updated list of trending queries on the platform. 8. ELI-53: This\\ndataset contains questions from the ELI5 subreddit, where users ask\\ncomplex questions and expect answers in simple, layman’s terms.\\n9. GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query\\ndistribution, we prompt GPT-4 [21] to generate queries ranging\\nfrom various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query\\nintent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and based on difficulty and\\nscope of generated response (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).\\n. Our benchmark comprises 10K queries divided into 8K, 1K, and\\n1K for train, validation, and test splits, respectively. We preserve\\nthe real-world query distribution, with our benchmark containing\\n80% informational queries and 10% each for transactional and navi-\\ngational queries. Each query is augmented with the cleaned text\\ncontent of the top 5 search results from the Google search engine.\\nTags. Optimizing website content often requires targeted changes\\nbased on the task’s domain. Additionally, a user of Generative\\nEngine Optimization may need to identify an appropriate method\\nfor only a subset of queries, considering multiple factors such as\\ndomain, user intent, and query nature. To facilitate this, we tag each\\nquery with one of seven different categories. For tagging, we em-\\nploy the GPT-4 model and manually verify high recall and precision\\non the test split.\\nOverall, GEO-bench consists of queries from 25 diverse domains\\nsuch as Arts, Health, and Games; it features a range of query diffi-\\nculties from simple to multi-faceted; includes 9 different types of\\nqueries such as informational and transactional; and encompasses\\n7 different categorizations. Owing to its specially designed high\\ndiversity, the size of the benchmark, and its real-world nature,GEO-\\nbench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Generative\\nEngines and serves as a standard testbed for assessing them for\\nvarious purposes in this and future works. We provide more details\\nabout GEO-bench in Appendix B.2.\\n3.3 GEO Methods\\nWe evaluate 9 different proposed GEO methods as described in\\nSection 2.2.2. We compare them with a baseline, which measures\\nthe impression metric of unmodified website sources. We evaluate\\nmethods on the complete GEO-bench test split. Further, to reduce\\nvariance in results, we run our experiments on five different random\\nseeds and report the average.\\n3.4 Evaluation Metrics\\nWe utilize the impression metrics as defined in Section 2.2.1. Specif-\\nically, we employ two impression metrics: 1. Position-Adjusted\\nWord Count, which combines word count and position count.\\nTo analyze the effect of individual components, we also report\\nscores on the two sub-metrics separately. 2. Subjective Impres-\\nsion, which is a subjective metric encompassing seven different\\naspects: 1) relevance of the cited sentence to the user query, 2) in-\\nfluence of the citation, assessing the extent to which the generated\\nresponse relies on the citation, 3) uniqueness of the material pre-\\nsented by a citation, 4) subjective position, gauging the prominence\\nof the positioning of source from the user’s viewpoint, 5) subjec-\\ntive count, measuring the amount of content presented from the\\n3https://huggingface.co/datasets/eli5_category'),\n",

These sub-\\nmetrics assess diverse aspects that content creators can target to\\nimprove one or more areas effectively. Each sub-metric is evaluated\\nusing GPT-3.5, following a methodology akin to that described in\\nG-Eval [15]. In G-Eval, a form-based evaluation template is pro-\\nvided to the language model, along with a GE generated response\\nwith citations. The model outputs a score (computed by sampling\\nmultiple times) for each citation. However, since G-Eval scores\\nare poorly calibrated, we normalize them to have the same mean\\nand variance as Position-Adjusted Word Count to enable a fair and\\nmeaningful comparison. We provide the exact templates used in\\nAppendix B.3.\\nFurthermore, all impression metrics are normalized by multiply-\\ning them with a constant factor so that the sum of the impressions\\nof all citations in a response equals 1. In our analysis, we compare\\nmethods by calculating the relative improvement in impression.\\nFor an initial generated response 𝑟 from sources 𝑆𝑖 ∈ { 𝑠1, . . . , 𝑠𝑚 },\\nand a modified response 𝑟 ′, the relative improvement in impression\\nfor each source 𝑠𝑖 is measured as:\\n𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑠𝑖 = 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑠𝑖 (𝑟 ′) − 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑠𝑖 (𝑟 )\\n𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑠𝑖 (𝑟 ) × 100 (4)\\nThe modified response 𝑟 ′ is produced by applying the GEO method\\nbeing evaluated to one of the sources 𝑠𝑖. The source 𝑠𝑖 selected\\nfor optimization is chosen randomly but remains constant for a\\nparticular query across all GEO methods.\\n4 RESULTS\\nWe evaluate various Generative Engine Optimization methods\\ndesigned to optimize website content for better visibility in Gener-\\native Engine responses, compared against a baseline with no opti-\\nmization. Our evaluation used GEO-bench, a diverse benchmark\\nof user queries from multiple domains and settings. Performance\\nwas measured using two metrics: Position-Adjusted Word Count and\\nSubjective Impression. The former considers word count and citation\\nposition in the GE’s response, while the latter computes multiple\\nsubjective factors, giving an overall impression score.\\nTable 1 details the absolute impression metrics of different meth-\\nods on multiple metrics. The results reveal that our GEO methods\\nconsistently outperform the baseline across all metrics on GEO-\\nbench. This shows the robustness of these methods to varying\\nqueries, yielding significant improvements despite query diver-\\nsity. Specifically, our top-performing methods, Cite Sources, Quota-\\ntion Addition, and Statistics Addition, achieved a relative improve-\\nment of 30-40% on the Position-Adjusted Word Count metric and\\n15-30% on the Subjective Impression metric. These methods, involv-\\ning adding relevant statistics (Statistics Addition), incorporating\\ncredible quotes (Quotation Addition), and including citations from\\nreliable sources (Cite Sources) in the website content, require mini-\\nmal changes but significantly improve visibility in GE responses,\\nenhancing both the credibility and richness of the content.\\nInterestingly, stylistic changes such as improving fluency and\\nreadability of the source text (Fluency Optimization and Easy-to-\\nUnderstand) also resulted in a significant visibility boost of 15-30%.\\nThis suggests that Generative Engines value not only content but\\nalso information presentation.'),\n",

This underscores the need for\\nwebsite owners to rethink optimization strategies for generative\\nengines, as techniques effective in search engines may not translate\\nto success in this new paradigm.\\n5 ANALYSIS\\n5.1 Domain-Specific Generative Engine\\nOptimizations\\nIn Section 4, we presented the improvements achieved by GEO\\nacross the entirety of the GEO-bench benchmark. However, in\\nreal-world SEO scenarios, domain-specific optimizations are often\\napplied. With this in mind, and considering that we provide cat-\\negories for every query in GEO-bench, we delve deeper into the\\nperformance of various GEO methods across these categories.\\nTable 3 provides a detailed breakdown of the categories where\\nour GEO methods have proven to be most effective. A careful anal-\\nysis of these results reveals several intriguing observations. For in-\\nstance, Authoritative significantly improves performance in debate-\\nstyle questions and queries related to the “historical” domain. This\\naligns with our intuition, as a more persuasive form of writing is\\nlikely to hold more value in debates.\\nSimilarly, the addition of citations through Cite Sources is par-\\nticularly beneficial for factual questions, likely because citations\\nprovide a source of verification for the facts presented, thereby en-\\nhancing the credibility of the response. The effectiveness of different\\nGEO methods varies across domains. For example, as shown in row\\n5 of Table 3, domains such as ‘Law & Government’ and question\\ntypes like ‘Opinion’ benefit significantly from the addition of rele-\\nvant statistics in the website content, as implemented by Statistics\\nAddition. This suggests that data-driven evidence can enhance the\\nvisibility of a website in particular contexts. The method Quotation\\nAddition is most effective in the ‘People & Society, ’ ‘Explanation, ’\\nand ‘History’ domains.

Overall, our anal-\\nysis suggests that website owners should strive towards making\\ndomain-specific targeted adjustments to their websites for higher\\nvisibility.\\n5.2 Optimization of Multiple Websites\\nIn the evolving landscape of Generative Engines, GEO methods are\\nexpected to become widely adopted, leading to a scenario where\\nall source contents are optimized using GEO. To understand the\\nimplications, we conducted an evaluation of GEO methods by opti-\\nmizing all source contents simultaneously, with results presented\\nin Table 2. A key observation is the differential impact of GEO\\non websites based on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP)\\nranking. Notably, lower-ranked websites, which typically struggle\\nfor visibility, benefit significantly more from GEO.

Without adding any substantial new information, GEO methods significantly increase the visibility of the source content.\\ngenerative models conditioned on website content, factors such\\nas backlink building should not disadvantage small creators. This\\nis evident from the relative improvements in visibility shown in\\nTable 2. For example, the Cite Sources method led to a substantial\\n115.1% increase in visibility for websites ranked fifth in SERP, while\\non average, the visibility of the top-ranked website decreased by\\n30.3%.\\nThis finding highlights GEO’s potential as a tool to democra-\\ntize the digital space. Many lower-ranked websites are created by\\nsmall content creators or independent businesses, who traditionally\\nstruggle to compete with larger corporations in top search engine\\nresults. The advent of Generative Engines might initially seem dis-\\nadvantageous to these smaller entities. However, the application\\nof GEO methods presents an opportunity for these content cre-\\nators to significantly improve their visibility in Generative Engine\\nresponses. By enhancing their content with GEO, they can reach\\na wider audience, leveling the playing field and allowing them to\\ncompete more effectively with larger corporations.\\n5.3 Combination of GEO Strategies\\nWhile individual GEO strategies show significant improvements\\nacross various domains, in practice, website owners are expected\\nto employ multiple strategies in conjunction. To study the perfor-\\nmance improvements achieved by combining GEO strategies, we\\nconsider all pairs of combinations of the top 4 performing GEO\\nmethods, namely Cite Sources, Fluency Optimization, Statistics\\nAddition, and Quotation Addition. Figure 4 displays the heatmap\\nof relative improvement in the Position-Adjusted Word Count visi-\\nbility metric achieved by combining different GEO strategies. The\\nanalysis demonstrates that the combination of Generative En-\\ngine Optimization methods can enhance performance, with the\\nbest combination (Fluency Optimization and Statistics Addition)\\noutperforming any single GEO strategy by more than 5.5%4. Fur-\\nthermore, Cite Sources significantly boosts performance when used\\n4Due to cost constraints, the analysis was conducted on a subset of 200 examples from\\nthe test split, and therefore the numbers presented here differ from those in Table 1\\nin conjunction with other methods (Average: 31.4%), despite it being\\nrelatively less effective when used alone (8% lower than Quotation\\nAddition). The findings underscore the importance of studyingGEO\\nmethods in combination, as they are likely to be used by content\\ncreators in the real world.\\n5.4 Qualitative Analysis\\nWe present a qualitative analysis of GEO methods in Table 4, con-\\ntaining representative examples where GEO methods boost source\\nvisibility with minimal changes. Each method optimizes a source\\nthrough suitable text additions and deletions. In the first example,\\nwe see that simply adding the source of a statement can significantly\\nboost visibility in the final answer, requiring minimal effort from\\nthe content creator. The second example demonstrates that adding\\nrelevant statistics wherever possible ensures increased source vis-\\nibility in the final Generative Engine response. Finally, the third\\nrow suggests that merely emphasizing parts of the text and using a\\npersuasive text style can also lead to improvements in visibility.\\n6 GEO IN THE WILD : EXPERIMENTS WITH\\nDEPLOYED GENERATIVE ENGINE\\nMethod Position-Adjusted Word Count Subjective Impression\\nNo Optimization 24.1 24 .7\\nKeyword Stuffing 21.9 28 .1\\nQuotation Addition 29.1 32.1\\nStatistics Addition 26.2 33.9\\nTable 5: Absolute impression metrics of GEO methods on\\nGEO-bench with Perplexity.ai as GE.

We refer readers to\\nAppendix C.1 for more details.\\n7 RELATED WORK\\nEvidence-based Answer Generation: Previous works have used\\nseveral techniques for answer generation backed by sources. Nakano\\net al. [19] trained GPT-3 to navigate web environments to generate\\nsource-backed answers. Similarly, other methods [17, 23, 24] fetch\\nsources via search engines for answer generation. Our work unifies\\nthese approaches and provides a common benchmark for improving\\nthese systems in the future. In a recent working draft, Kumar and\\nLakkaraju [11] showed that strategic text sequences can manipulate\\nLLM recommendations to enhance product visibility in generative\\nengines. While their approach focuses on increasing product visibil-\\nity through adversarial text, our method introduces non-adversarial\\nstrategies to optimize any website content for improved visibility\\nin generative engine search results.\\nRetrieval-Augmented Language Models: Several recent works\\nhave tackled the issues of limited memory of language models\\nby fetching relevant sources from a knowledge base to complete a\\ntask [3, 9, 18]. However, Generative Engine needs to generate an\\nanswer and provide attributions throughout the answer. Further,\\nGenerative Engine is not limited to a single text modality regarding\\nboth input and output. Additionally, the framework of Generative\\nEngine is not limited to fetching relevant sources but instead com-\\nprises multiple tasks such as query reformulation, source selection,\\nand making decisions on how and when to perform them.\\nSearch Engine Optimization: In nearly the past 25 years, extensive\\nresearch has optimized web content for search engines [2, 12, 22].\\nThese methods fall into On-Page SEO, improving content and user\\nexperience, and Off-Page SEO, boosting website authority through\\nlink building. In contrast, GEO deals with a more complex envi-\\nronment involving multi-modality, conversational settings. Since\\nGEO is optimized against a generative model not limited to simple\\nkeyword matching, traditional SEO strategies will not apply to\\nGenerative Engine settings, highlighting the need for GEO.\\n8 CONCLUSION\\nIn this work, we formulate search engines augmented with genera-\\ntive models that we dub generative engines. We propose Genera-\\ntive Engine Optimization (GEO) to empower content creators\\nto optimize their content under generative engines. We define im-\\npression metrics for generative engines and propose and release\\nGEO-bench: a benchmark encompassing diverse user queries from\\nmultiple domains and settings, along with relevant sources needed\\nto answer those queries. We propose several ways to optimize con-\\ntent for generative engines and demonstrate that these methods can\\nboost source visibility by up to 40% in generative engine responses.\\nAmong other findings, we show that including citations, quotations\\nfrom relevant sources, and statistics can significantly boost source\\nvisibility. Further, we discover a dependence of GEO methods’ ef-\\nfectiveness on the query domain and the potential of combining\\nmultiple GEO strategies in conjunction. We show promising results\\non a commercially deployed generative engine with millions of\\nactive users, showcasing the real-world impact of our work. In sum-\\nmary, our work is the first to formalize the important and timely\\nGEO paradigm, releasing algorithms and infrastructure (bench-\\nmarks, datasets, and metrics) to facilitate rapid progress in genera-\\ntive engines by the community. This serves as a first step towards\\nunderstanding the impact of generative engines on the digital space\\nand the role of GEO in this new paradigm of search engines.\\n9 LIMITATIONS\\nWhile we rigorously test our proposed methods on two generative\\nengines, including a publicly available one, methods may need to\\nadapt over time as GEs evolve, mirroring the evolution of SEO.\\nAdditionally, despite our efforts to ensure the queries in our GEO-\\nbench closely resemble real-world queries, the nature of queries\\ncan change over time, necessitating continuous updates. Further,\\nowing to the black-box nature of search engine algorithms, we\\ndidn’t evaluate howGEO methods affect search rankings. However,\\nwe note that changes made by GEO methods are targeted changes\\nin textual content, bearing some resemblance with SEO methods,\\nwhile not affecting other metadata such as domain name, backlinks,\\netc, and thus, they are less likely to affect search engine rankings.\\nFurther, as larger context lengths in language models become eco-\\nnomical, it is expected that future generative models will be able to\\ningest more sources, thus reducing the impact of search rankings.\\nLastly, while every query in our proposedGEO-bench is tagged and\\nmanually inspected, there may be discrepancies due to subjective\\ninterpretations or errors in labeling.\\n10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science\\nFoundation under Grant No. 2107048.

The cited\\nsearch result(s) should fully support _all_ the information\\nin the sentence. Search results need to be cited using [\\nindex].

You can use multiple search\\nresults to respond comprehensively while avoiding\\nirrelevant search results.\\n2\\n3 Question: {query}\\n4\\n5 Search Results :\\n6 {source_text}\\nA CONVERSATIONAL GENERATIVE ENGINE\\nIn Section 2.1, we discussed a single-turn Generative Enginethat\\noutputs a single response given the user query. However, one of the\\nstrengths of upcoming Generative Engines will be their ability to\\nengage in an active back-and-forth conversation with the user. The\\nconversation allows users to provide clarifications to their queries\\nor Generative Engine response and ask follow-ups. Specifically,\\nin equation 1, instead of the input being a single query 𝑞𝑢, it is\\nmodeled as a conversation history 𝐻 = (𝑞𝑡𝑢, 𝑟𝑡 ) pairs. The response\\n𝑟𝑡 +1 is then defined as:\\n𝐺𝐸 := 𝑓𝐿𝐸 (𝐻, 𝑃𝑈 ) → 𝑟 𝑡 +1 (5)\\nwhere 𝑡 is the turn number.\\nFurther, to engage the user in a conversation, a separate LLM,\\n𝐿𝑓 𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 or 𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝 , may generate suggested follow-up queries based\\non 𝐻, 𝑃𝑈 , and 𝑟𝑡 +1. The suggested follow-up queries are typically\\ndesigned to maximize the likelihood of user engagement. This\\nnot only benefits Generative Engine providers by increasing user\\ninteraction but also benefits website owners by enhancing their\\nvisibility. Furthermore, these follow-up queries can help users by\\ngetting more detailed information.\\nB EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nB.1 Evaluated Generative Engine\\nThe exact prompt used is shown in Listing 1.\\nB.2 Benchmark\\nGEO-bench contains queries from nine datasets. Representative\\nqueries from each of the datasets are shown in Figure 2. Further, we\\ntag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For\\ntagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall\\nand precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated\\nsystem, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered carefully.\\nDetails about each of these queries are presented here:\\nListing 2: Representative Queries from each of the 9 datasets\\nin GEO-bench\\n1 ### ORCAS\\n2 - what does globalization mean\\n3 - wine pairing list\\n4\\n5 ### AllSouls\\n6 - Are open-access journals the future of academic publishing?\\n7 - Should the study of non-Western philosophy be a requirement\\nfor a philosophy degree in the UK?\\n8\\n9 ### Davinci-Debate\\n10 - Should all citizens receive a basic income?\\n11 - Should governments promote atheism?\\n12\\n13 ### ELI5\\n14 - Why does my cat kick its toys when playing with them?\\n15 - what does caffeine actually do your muscles, especially\\nregarding exercising?\\n16\\n17 ### GPT-4\\n18 - What are the benefits of a keto diet?\\n19 - What are the most profound impacts of the Renaissance period\\non modern society?\\n20\\n21 ### LIMA\\n22 - What are the primary factors that influence consumer behavior?\\n23 - What would be a great twist for a murder mystery?
